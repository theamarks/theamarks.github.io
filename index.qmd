<span style = 'font-size: 85%;'>I am a perpetual learner driven by curiosity and the idea of building a world where human and environmental well-being can thrive. As an avid outdoors person, I find solace during a challenging climb up a snow-covered ridge. However, my most rewarding work is using data and technology to assemble a healthier planet and support a just society. I strive towards this goal with genuine interpersonal communication and a dose of levity, while learning from others and my mistakes.</span>

As an avid outdoors person, I find solace during a challenging climb up a snow-covered ridge. However, my most rewarding work is using data and technology to assemble a healthier planet and support a just society. I strive towards this goal with genuine interpersonal communication and a dose of levity, while learning from others and my mistakes."

This required partnering with 23 government, non-profit, and academic organizations and working closely with the NOOC core team.

### Overview

As the Database Analyst for NOOC ([Native Olympia Oyster Collaborative](https://olympiaoysternet.ucdavis.edu/)), I built an online data collection survey (Qualtrics) and created a database of all Olympia oyster restoration projects. This required partnering with 23 government, non-profit, and academic organizations and working closely with the NOOC core team. I build data visualizations (Figure 2) and maps (Figure 1) for the peer-reviewed paper and assisted with analyses.
